    cmd/cue: fix panic when importing empty files as a list
    
    Empty files are represented as nil when parsed, which causes cue to
    panic as the condition is not considered when asked to import as a list.
    
    Fixes #2721

    cmd/cue: fix incorrect position in yaml import
    
    Position information of the CUE AST is represented with bytes, whereas
    the YAML decoder represents position information with characters. The
    mismatch could result in incorrect and strange positions in the CUE AST
    from decoded YAML files.
    
    The simplest thing to do is to change the YAML decoder to represent
    position information as bytes. Other solutions may be complex or
    computationally expensive. I do not see the character index used in any
    meaningful way when decoding, so I believe this to be a safe change.
    
    In addition, it seems position information for decoded YAML documents
    may have been off by one, which has also been addressed. Position
    information for sequence end tokens were also invalid (or missing) and
    is now correctly set to the starting position of the sequence end event.
    
    The Kubernetes tutorial files have been updated to match the changes as
    a result of the corrected position information.

    cmd/cue: support optional comments in get go
    
    The Kuberentes ecosystem use comments to denote whether a field is
    optional or required. The comment has a direct effect on the produced
    OpenAPI schema, and often means otherwise correct Go "schemas" will be
    represented incorrectly with CUE.
    
    https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/e977e6ea355f26130ca555d1e8704893727ee024/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#optional-vs-required
    
    In addition to the heuristics of the "omitempty" struct tag, the
    "// +optional" comment will now also mark a field as optional. The
    behaviour from the Kubernetes project which parses this comment as a
    key/value pair (tag) is also preserved.

    cmd/cue: ignore complex types in get go
    
    Complex numbers have no opaque representation in Go. The real and
    imaginary parts of a complex number are only accessible using the
    inbuilt functions real and imag. There is also no agreed upon standard
    for representing complex numbers in other data formats like JSON or
    YAML. Most encoders will simply write strings in the form "1+2i". I
    think the safest thing to do for now is to represent complex numbers
    with top, and adjust this in future if needed.
    
    Fixes #2661

    cmd/format: be consistent with whitespace in lists
    
    Leading whitespace is not strictly enforced, but is incorrectly present
    when the formatting of a list is fixed. The behaviour can be made
    consistent by requesting no blanks at the start of a list.
    
            ```diff
            -[ 1]
            -[ for x in y {}]

    Go type parameters are represented as their basic types in most cases, but
    there are some more complicated areas which are not handled yet. These
    cases are documented clearly as TODOs and may be good candidates for
    improvement work in future. For now, this should unblock importing some
    packages.

    cue/format: indent list elements correctly
    
    Vertical tabs are used when printing some struct fields
    for the sake of vertical alignment of the values.
    This does not happen for fields where the value needs a form feed,
    for the sake of not aligning every single struct field.
    For example, we don't align those with struct and list values
    since they tend to be complex or take multiple lines.
    
    The logic to detect whether a field value needs a form feed was brittle
    since it only looked for a struct or list directly in the expression,
    entirely missing one if it was behind a unary or binary expression.
    Fix up that logic and update the tests.
    
    Fixes #2314.
    
    Closes #2645 as merged as of commit cff4c1a1.
