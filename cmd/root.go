	Short: "Tools for investigation of CUE issues related to formatting.",
	Long: `Tools for investigation of CUE issues related to formatting.

	This evolving set of tools requires a compatible set of patches to the CUE source code (*).

	As of 7 Jan 2024, the CUE patch extras are turned on by setting these environment variables to non-empty values:

	CUEDO_AST_SPEW - turns on the AST spew mode
	CUEDO_AST_TREE - turns on the AST tree mode
	CUEDO_AST_TYPE - turns on the AST type mode
	CUEDO_FBB_KLUDGE - turns on a kludge in formatter to anticipate a fix for the issue #2567
	CUEDO_FORMATTER_HEXDUMP - turns on hex dump of the formatter's internal buffer, as each fragment is printed
	CUEDO_FORMATTER_STACKTRACE - turns on dump of a stack trace in the formatter, as each fragment is printed
	CUEDO_PARSER_COMMENTS_POS - adds to the parser.Trace mode data about the comment positions and texts
	CUEDO_PARSER_DEBUG_STR - turns on the parser debug string mode
	CUEDO_PARSER_TRACE - turns on the parser.Trace mode

	Note that these patches are not part of the official CUE source code and are not supported by the CUE team.
